                <p>The Ecology Action Centre has been helping promote various causes since 1971, focused on promoting alternative practises and provincial policies that focus on 
                protecting the local environment. Ranging from being early promoters of recycling in Halifax back in the 70s to more recent efforts to ammend the Provincial 
                Parks Act to better protect green spaces from future development projects.
